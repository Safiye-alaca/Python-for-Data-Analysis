# 📊 Python for Data Analysis - Study Notes & Applications

This repository contains my step-by-step implementation of the examples, exercises, and technical notes from the book **"Python for Data Analysis" (3rd Edition)** by Wes McKinney.



## 🚀 Objective
The goal of this project is to master the core ecosystem of Python data science, specifically focusing on **Pandas**, **NumPy**, and **IPython**. I am documenting my journey through data cleaning, manipulation, and processing techniques to build a solid foundation for data science and analytics.


## 🛠️ Tech Stack
* **Language:** Python 3.x
* **Libraries:** Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, LXML, OpenPyXL, PyTables
* **Environment:** VS Code & Jupyter Notebooks
* **Package Management:** Python Virtual Environment (`.venv`)

## 💡 Key Technical Takeaways
Throughout this study, I have gained deep insights into:
* **Complex Data Parsing:** Converting hierarchical XML and JSON structures into flat Pandas DataFrames.
* **Performance Optimization:** Utilizing binary formats like **HDF5** and **Parquet** for efficient storage and fast I/O.
* **Web Scraping:** Using `read_html` to automate data extraction from web tables.
* **Excel Integration:** Managing multi-sheet Excel files and handling index columns during import/export.
